# Special Castle Game and Apple Distribution Projects

This repository contains solutions for three programming problems: Flight Path Drawing, Apple Distribution, and Special Castle Game.

## Approach

- The Flight Path Drawing program uses a simple grid-based approach for visualization.
- For each pair of flights, check if their line segments intersect.
- If an intersection is detected, modify the path of one or both flights to avoid the intersection
- The Apple Distribution algorithm aims for fairness but may not always achieve perfect distribution due to the constraint of not cutting apples.
- The Special Castle Game implements a basic backtracking algorithm to find possible paths.

## Research and References

During the development of these programs, I consulted various online resources and used AI assistance. Here are the main sources of reference:

1. Java Documentation: 
   - Oracle Java SE Documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/)
   - Used for refreshing knowledge on Java collections and basic syntax

2. StackOverflow:
   - Searched for efficient ways to implement line drawing algorithms
   - Referred to discussions on distributing items proportionally

3. GeeksforGeeks:
   - Article on Bresenham's line algorithm (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bresenhams-line-generation-algorithm/)
   - Used as a basis for the line drawing function in the Flight Path problem

4. Claude AI:
   - Used for code structure suggestions and problem-solving approaches
   - Helped in breaking down complex problems into manageable steps

5. GitHub:
   - Browsed similar projects for inspiration on code organization and best practices

These resources were invaluable in developing efficient and readable solutions for the given problems. The final implementations are my own work, integrating ideas and techniques learned from these sources.
